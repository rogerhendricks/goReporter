# ICD (Implantable Cardioverter-Defibrillator)

## What it is

An ICD is an implanted device that can provide pacing and deliver therapies intended to treat certain dangerous ventricular arrhythmias.

## Common data you may see in reports

- Therapy logs (e.g., shocks or pacing therapies, when present)
- Episode summaries (arrhythmia detections and classification)
- Battery status / estimated longevity
- Lead status / impedance trends
- Sensing/capture metrics

## Typical workflows in this app

- Review reports for episode/therapy entries and correlate with symptoms and follow-up notes.
- Assign Tasks for post-episode outreach or clinic follow-up.
- Use the Report Builder to filter cohorts (e.g., by patient tags, device types) for productivity or quality audits.
