# Pacemaker

## What it is

A pacemaker is an implanted cardiac device that provides pacing therapy when the heart rate is too slow or conduction is impaired.

## Common data you may see in reports

- Pacing percentages (atrial/ventricular)
- Battery status / estimated longevity
- Lead status / impedance trends
- Sensed and paced events
- Episodes relevant to bradycardia or conduction issues

## Typical workflows in this app

- Review patient reports for pacing burden changes and battery trends.
- Use Tasks to track follow-ups (e.g., device checks, symptom calls).
- Use tag-based reporting to find cohorts (e.g., "Pacemaker" patients, vendor-specific groups).

## Notes

This page is intended as an internal reference for how pacemakers show up in the application and in device reports. Clinical decisions should follow your organization’s protocols.
