# Loop Recorder (ILR)

## What it is

An implantable loop recorder (ILR) is a small implanted monitor that records cardiac rhythm events over time. It’s commonly used for longer-term rhythm surveillance.

## Common data you may see in reports

- Recorded rhythm episodes (depending on report/source)
- Event timestamps and durations
- Burden-style summaries (when provided)
- Patient-triggered events (when present)

## Typical workflows in this app

- Review incoming ILR reports for episode trends.
- Create Tasks for follow-up calls, medication review, or clinic visits as needed.
- Tag patients to support cohort reporting (e.g., "ILR", "Syncope workup").
