## How to Use Filters

### Combining Filters
Apply multiple filters together - tasks must match ALL selected criteria.

- Priority: `High`
- Due Date: `This Week`

**Result:** Shows only high-priority tasks you're currently working on that are due within 7 days.

2. **Priority dropdown** - Select priority level
3. **Due Date dropdown** - Select date range
