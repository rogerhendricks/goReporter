# Access Requests

## Overview
Secure workflow for doctors to request access to patient records, with administrators reviewing and approving or denying requests.

## Who Can Use This

## Access Types

### Temporary Access
- Granted for a specific time period
- Automatically expires after the set date
- Best for short-term care or consultations
- Example: 30-day access for a consultation

### Permanent Access
- Ongoing access to patient records
- Remains until explicitly revoked
- Best for primary care physicians
- Regular patients under your care
